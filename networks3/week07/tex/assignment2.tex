\title{ Assignment 2 \\ DHCP \\ IN715 Networks Three}
\date{\today}
\maketitle

\section*{Introduction}
For this assignment you will deploy a DNS system for a small network that will include a BIND on OpenBSD and a slave server on Windows Server 2012R2.

This assignment is due on Friday, 19 September.  It is worth 20\% of your overall mark in the paper.

\section{DHCP server on OpenBSD}
You will configure the ISC DHCP server on your OpenBSD server.  Your configuration will satisfy the following requirements:

\begin{itemize}
  \item It will configure nw3.sqrawler.com as the domain name;
  \item It will give two addresses for DNS servers: The address of your OpenBSD server and the address of your Windows server;
  \item Your server will be authoritative;
  \item It will use an address pool of 172.16.xxx.100 - 172.16.xxx.150\footnote{Substitute in the appropriate value for your subnet for ``xxx''}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The gateway for this pool will be 172.16.xxx.1;
      \item The default lease time shall be 1 day;
      \item The maximum lease time shall be 3 days;
    \end{itemize}
  \item On the same network as the pool above, reserve an address of
        172.16.xxx.30 for your Linux client on that network;
  \item It will use a second  address pool of 192.168.2.50 - 192.168.2.100
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The gateway for this pool will be 192.168.2.2
      \item The default lease time shall be 8 hours
      \item The maximum lease time shall be 12 hours.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\section{Assignment submission}
Prepare the DNS system described above on your provided VMWare virtual systems by  the end of the day on 19 September.  The lecturer shall evaluate the configuration of the servers and test their functionality on each of the clients to be sure it satisfies the requirements.
