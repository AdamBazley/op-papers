\section*{Theory Exam}
The theory exam will take place during the first session of the final week of the semester. Access to notes, the Internet, and other resources is premitted. 
The exam is mostly going to be about a big-picture understanding of the topics.  You won't be asked to write code, but you may see some code and be asked questions
about it.

Topics that may be included on the exam include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Model-View-Controller architecture, with special attention to the role of models;
	\item The role of an integration (API) server in a database application stack;
	\item REST API's, (think in particular how HTTP verbs are mapped to CRUD operations);
	\item Types of databases (Relational, Document-Based, Key-Value stores)
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Be able to explain how data is represented in each
		\item Compare their relative strengths and weaknesses
		\item Describe how a simple data model could be stored in each type of database - how would you represnt 1-to-many or many-to-many
	\end{itemize}
        \item Be able to explain, in a couple of sentences of plain English, what MapReduce is.
\end{itemize}
