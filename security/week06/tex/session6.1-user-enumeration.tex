\title{User Enumeration\\ IN618 Security}
\date{}
\maketitle

\section*{Introduction}
In this lab we will explore a simple vulnerability that is easily overlooked, \emph{user enumeration}.

\section{Probe for the vulnerability}
Examine the web site at \url{http://in618.sqrawler.com/users/}.  There are 
about one thousand registered user names, all common first names (in lowercase).  
They also have an easily guessed password.  Attempt to log into the site with 
various usernames and make note of what heppens.

1.  Try the user name \texttt{fred} with password \texttt{123}. What
happens?

2. Try the user name \texttt{joe} with password \texttt{123}.  What happens?

\vspace{15mm}

3.  Find three other valid user names on this system and write them below.

4.  What is the significance of your findings above?  How does this create a 
security vulnerablity?

\newpage     

5.  How would you modify the login code to remove the vulnerability?
